        "text": "The SHITHEAD of the last round shuffles the cards and deals 3 cards face down in front of each player (don't pick up).\nOn top of the first 3 cards he then deals another 3 cards face up for each player.\nFinally, he deals another 3 cards face down to each player and puts the remaining cards as draw stack on the table.\nThe last 3 cards are picked up by the players and may be freely exchanged with the open cards lying in front of them (the basic strategy is to have good cards on the table for the end game)."

        "text": "The player with the worst card on hand (4\u2663,4\u2660,4\u2666,4\u2665,5\u2663,...) starts the game by playing one of his hand cards as start of the discard pile. He may also play any number of hand cards with the same rank as the first one (e.g. 4\u2660 and 4\u2665) and then refills his hand to 3 cards. Again he may play cards of the same rank as the 1st card, if he draws them while refilling his hand, but still has to fill up his hand to 3 cards.\nNow the game continues clockwise, with each player playing at least one card and then refilling his hand up to 3 cards (as long as there are cards in the draw stack).\nIf a player cannot play cards (see rules for playing a card below), he takes all the cards from the discard pile onto his hand (but he does not have to take a card from the draw stack) and play continues with the next player, who starts a new discard pile with an arbitrary card.\nAfter the draw stack has been emptied the players first try to get rid of their hand cards and then of their face up table cards. The face down table cards are played as last cards without looking at them.\nPlay continues till all but one player have gotten rid of their cards.\nThe last player with cards is the SHITHEAD and deals for the next game (while the player who got rid of his cards first, has time to go to the restrooms and to get another round of beers)."
